# Spinach Sloppy Joes with Stir-Fried Vegetables

## Ingredients

### For Sloppy Joes:
- 1 lb lean ground beef
- 1 packet sloppy joe seasoning mix
- 6 oz can tomato paste
- 1 cup water (adjust as needed)
- 1/2 lb fresh spinach, roughly chopped
- Hamburger buns

### For Stir-Fried Vegetables:
- 1 lb 8 oz mixed vegetables (broccoli, carrots, snow peas)
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 2 tbsp coconut aminos
- Optional: garlic powder, chopped fresh tomatoes

## Instructions

### Prep:
1. **Prepare Ingredients**: Wash and roughly chop spinach. If using fresh tomatoes for the stir-fry, chop them now.

### Sloppy Joes:
1. **Brown the Beef**: In a large skillet over medium heat, cook the ground beef until no longer pink. Drain any excess fat.
2. **Add Spinach**: Incorporate the chopped spinach and cook until wilted.
3. **Combine Mix**: Stir in the sloppy joe seasoning, tomato paste, and water. Mix well.
4. **Simmer**: Let the mixture simmer on low for about 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally. Adjust seasoning and water as necessary.

### Stir-Fried Vegetables:
1. **Heat Oil**: While the sloppy joe mix simmers, heat olive oil in a large wok or skillet over medium-high heat.
2. **Stir-Fry Vegetables**: Add mixed vegetables and stir-fry for 5-7 minutes until tender-crisp. Season with salt, pepper, and optional garlic powder.
3. **Season with Coconut Aminos**: Add coconut aminos, stirring to coat evenly. Add the chopped tomatoes at the end if using, just to warm them.

### Toasting Buns:
1. **Toast Buns**: During the last few minutes of cooking, toast the hamburger buns in the oven or on a pan to help them hold up against the sloppy joe mix.

## Serving Suggestion:
Serve the spinach sloppy joes on toasted hamburger buns with the stir-fried vegetables on the side.
