# aiCookbook

## Project Overview
The `aiCookbook` is a dynamic web application designed to store and display a collection of recipes in a user-friendly format. It enables users to search, view, and share a wide variety of recipes presented in markdown format, enhancing the accessibility and usability of culinary content. Additionally, the application now supports displaying images alongside recipes, offering a more engaging user experience.

## Features
- **Recipe Display:** Recipes are rendered in the browser using markdown formatting, ensuring a clean and consistent presentation. Each recipe is accompanied by an image that enhances the visual appeal and provides a visual reference for the dish.
- **Search Functionality:** Users can search for recipes by name, filtering the available content to find what they're looking for quickly.
- **Responsive Design:** The application is responsive, making it accessible on a wide range of devices from desktops to mobile phones.
- **Share Capability:** Users can share recipes via a permalink, utilizing the browser's native share API when available.
- **Image Integration:** For each recipe displayed, the application attempts to load a corresponding image (JPEG, JPG, PNG formats) that matches the recipe file name, enriching the presentation and appeal of the recipes.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML/CSS:** For structuring and styling the web pages.
- **JavaScript:** To handle the dynamic aspects of the application such as loading recipes, searching, sharing, and dynamically loading images.
- **Markdown-it:** A JavaScript markdown parser used to convert markdown files into HTML.
- **Spectre.css:** A lightweight CSS framework that provides basic styling for the application without the overhead of more extensive frameworks.

## Directory Structure
- `index.html`: The entry point of the application which loads the entire app.
- `style.css`: Contains all the custom styles used throughout the application.
- `script.js`: Handles all the interactions within the application, including loading recipes, searching, initializing UI components, and dynamically loading images.
- `*.md`: Markdown files for each recipe, named sequentially (e.g., `001.md`, `002.md`, ...).
- `*.jpg`, `*.jpeg`, `*.png`: Image files that match the markdown files to visually represent the recipes.
  
## Usage
- Use the search box at the top to find recipes by keywords.
- Click on any recipe button to view the full recipe along with its image.
- Use the 'Share' button to share the recipe with others.

### Consistent Recipe Format
Each markdown recipe is meticulously structured to ensure ease of use and clarity:
- **Title**: Descriptive and formatted as a level 2 heading (`##`).
- **Ingredients Section**: Categorized by type and listed with precise descriptions.
- **Equipment Needed Section**: Outlines necessary tools and is formatted as a simple bullet list.
- **Instructions Section**: Numbered steps with bolded action words to guide users through the cooking process.
- **Shopping List Section**: Organized by categories, with interactive checkboxes for user convenience.

### Markdown Features Utilized
- **Bold** for emphasis.
- **Bullet lists** for ingredients and equipment.
- **Numbered lists** for step-by-step instructions.
- **Checkboxes** for shopping lists.

This structured approach not only maintains uniformity across the digital cookbook but also enhances the user experience by making recipes easy to follow and visually engaging.

Hereâ€™s a prompt you can use to get a recipe in the structured format for `aiCookbook`:

---

"Could you provide a markdown recipe for [RECIPE NAME OR DESCRIPTION HERE], including sections for ingredients, equipment needed, instructions, and a shopping list? Please structure with headings for each section, bolded categories, and numbered steps for the instructions." 

---

Just replace "[RECIPE NAME OR DESCRIPTION HERE]" with the specific recipe or type of dish you are interested in.
