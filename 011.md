### Instructions:

1. **Prepare the Squash**:
   - Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C).
   - Cut the butternut squash in half lengthwise and remove the seeds.
   - Place the squash halves on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, cut side up.
   - Drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and pepper.
   - Roast in the oven for about 45 minutes or until the squash is tender.
   - Once cooled, scoop out the squash flesh into a food processor, add Parmesan cheese and nutmeg, and blend until smooth.

2. **Make the Pasta Dough**:
   - In a large bowl, mix the flour and salt.
   - Make a well in the center and add the eggs.
   - Gradually mix the flour into the eggs until a dough forms.
   - Knead the dough on a floured surface until smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes.
   - Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and let it rest for 30 minutes.

3. **Form the Ravioli**:
   - Divide the pasta dough into four equal parts.
   - Roll out each part into a thin sheet using a pasta maker or a rolling pin.
   - Place small spoonfuls of squash filling about 1 inch apart on half of the pasta sheet.
   - Fold the other half over the filling and press down around the edges to seal.
   - Cut the ravioli using a ravioli cutter or a glass and fork to crimp the edges.

4. **Cook the Ravioli**:
   - Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
   - Cook the ravioli in batches for about 4 minutes or until they float to the surface.

5. **Prepare the Sauce**:
   - In a skillet, melt the butter over medium heat.
   - Add the garlic and sage leaves, cooking until the butter is slightly browned.
   - Season with salt and pepper.

6. **Serve**:
   - Toss the cooked ravioli in the sage butter sauce.
