### Equipment Needed:

### Instructions:

1. **Prep the Chicken**:
   - Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat.
   - Season the chicken breasts with cumin, garlic powder, salt, and pepper.
   - Cook the chicken for about 5-7 minutes per side or until fully cooked.
   - Remove from the skillet, let cool slightly, and then shred using two forks.

2. **Warm the Refried Beans**:
   - Warm the refried beans in a microwave or in a small pot on the stove until they're easy to spread.

3. **Assemble the Taquitos**:
   - Preheat the oven to 400Â°F (if baking).
   - Wrap the tortillas in a damp cloth and microwave for about 30 seconds to make them more pliable.
   - Spread a thin layer of refried beans on each tortilla.
   - Sprinkle some cheese in the middle, and top with about 2 tablespoons of shredded chicken.
   - Roll the tortilla tightly around the filling and secure with a toothpick if needed.
   - Repeat with the remaining tortillas and filling.

4. **Cook the Taquitos**:
   - **For Baking**: Place taquitos seam-side down on a foil or parchment-lined baking sheet. Bake for 15-20 minutes or until the tortillas are crisp and golden.
